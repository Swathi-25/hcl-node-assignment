# API's

1 - http://localhost:3000/approute/ (to output a file content from any local directory )

2 - http://localhost:3000/approute/product?num=5&num2=10 (to find product of param1 and param2)

3 - http://localhost:3000/approute/nonrepeatingchars?s=aabbyhhj (to first non repeating character in given input)
